# Geeky Backend Developer

I am a highly motivated backend developer with a strong passion for Linux, Emacs, PHP, Laravel, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have several years of experience in the industry and I am skilled in creating high-quality, scalable software solutions. I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies and programming languages to stay updated on the latest trends and advancements in the field.

I have worked on various projects, and have experience with different programming languages and frameworks. I have a good understanding of software development methodologies and best practices, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects. I believe that contributing to open-source community is a way to give back to the community and also to learn new things.
